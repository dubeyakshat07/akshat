    Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Akshat Dubey, a Research Associate at the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de) (An Institute Under the Portfolio of The Federal Ministry of Health)in Berlin, Germany, and a PhD candidate at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. My expertise lies in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), exploring the convergence of human-computer interaction and visualization. Proficient in deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and graph neural networks, I contribute to healthcare technology and broader AI advancements. I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. PD. Habil. Georges Hattab, our Research Group Leader at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence within [Visualization Group](https://www.rki.de) (ZKI-PH5). Focused on AI and Visualization Methods, our collaborative research aims to push the boundaries of innovation in these domains. Dr. Hattab's mentorship enriches our collective exploration, shaping our endeavors in AI. This portfolio not only highlights my individual contributions but also showcases the collective impact of our research group's work at the forefront of artificial intelligence and visualization methods. Join me on this journey, exploring the possibilities at the nexus of AI, visualization, and human understanding.
